units lj                      #this means we are using arbitrary length and energy units, as in v_LJ: no physical units are assigned to particles.

boundary p p p                #periodic boundary conditions in all 3 dimensions

lattice fcc 0.3                     #defines a face-centered cubic lattice of number density 0.3

mass 1 1.0                    #sets the mass of atoms of type "1" that we just created
velocity all create 1.5 2023    #gives all atom of a random velocity, such that the initial temperature is 1.5. 2023 is a random seed here.

pair_style lj/cut 2.5         #defines the LJ potential. It is cut off (v(r) set to 0) after r > 2.5 \sigma
pair_coeff 1 1 1.0 1.0        #sets the LJ coefficients \varepsilon and \sigma between atom types "1" and "1". We simply set both \varepsilon and \sigma to be 1.

fix 1 all nvt temp 1.5 0.01 $(10.0*dt)  #sets the equation of state: we are fixing number of particles, volume and temperature during each time step.
